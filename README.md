# <prework-study-guide Webpage>

## Description

This was created as a bootcamp prework assignment to get familiar with the work flow and tools used to become a web developer. Prework included HTML, CSS, JS and Git.


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

To use the study guide you can review the notes on each section. To find inspiration on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+options(alt)+I (MacOS) or Control+shift+I (windows). A console panel shoud open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features
N/A

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
