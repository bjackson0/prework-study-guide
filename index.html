        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on Command-(git status)</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it Command-(git checkout -b "enter branch name)</li>
          <li>The "add" command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit. Now that we have staged those files to be committed, let’s enter the git commit command with a commit message that describes what the commit contains. Enter the following git command in the command line: git commit -m "add starter code"</li>
          <li>Before we push this up to our repo, we should double-check if our local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub. So let’s pull down any changes from the base branch. Enter the following git command in the command line: "git pull origin main" Let's take a look at what we just wrote. Once again, we identify a Git command with the git keyword. Then use the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository. It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work.</li>
